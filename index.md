I am a research scientist at <b>Facebook AI (FAIR)</b> in NYC and broadly study foundational topics and applications in <b>machine learning</b> (sometimes deep) and <b>optimization</b> (sometimes convex), including reinforcement learning, computer vision, language, statistics, and theory. I have a Ph.D. from <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b> and was advised by [Zico Kolter](http://zicokolter.com/) and supported by an <b>NSF graduate research fellowship.</b> My thesis is on [Differentiable Optimization-Based Modeling for Machine Learning](https://github.com/bamos/thesis). My publications are available below and on [my Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d8gdZR4AAAAJ) and my open source contributions can be found on [my Github profile](https://github.com/bamos). I have also worked on <b>reinforcement learning</b> during an internship with [Nando de Freitas](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/) and [Misha Denil](http://mdenil.com/) at <b>DeepMind</b> in 2017 and on vision with [Vladlen Koltun](http://vladlen.info/) at <b>Intel Labs</b> in 2018.
